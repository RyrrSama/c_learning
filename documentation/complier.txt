To run c/c++ code use gcc complier

    To compile and run C code:

        To compile c code use the following command:

            gcc <src_file>.c -o file <object_file_name>.o -I <header_files_dir_path> -L <Library_file_dir_path>

        * This will generate the exe file for the c code

        To Run c o file use the following command:

            <object_file_dir_path>/<object_file>.o

    To compile and run C++ code:

        To compile c++ code use the following command:

            g++ <src_file>.cpp -o file <object_file_name>.o -I <header_files_dir_path> -L <Library_file_dir_path>

        * This will generate the exe file for the c++ code

        To Run c++ exe file use the following command:

            <object_file_dir_path>/<object_file>.0

    To Create a obj file from a .c file use -c and -o flag to rename the output file

        gcc -c -o <obj_filepath\file_name>.o <src_folder_path>\src_file_name>.c

    To create a executable from .o file in gcc
        gcc -o <excutable_folder_path\executable_file_name> [<object_file_name>.o,..]
